# Load Balancing in AWS

Load balancing in AWS is managed by the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service. It automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. This distribution can occur across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance in your applications. 

There are three types of load balancers that AWS provides: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Classic Load Balancer. Each type is designed to handle different scenarios and workloads. 

Load balancing increases the availability and fault tolerance of an application, improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, and helps in achieving maximum application performance.
