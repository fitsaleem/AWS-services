# Choose the Right Storage Service

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on selecting the right storage service for your needs! By the end of this document, you'll have a clearer understanding of how to choose between various storage options available on AWS.

## Amazon EC2 Instance Store

The **EC2 Instance Store** provides ephemeral block storage directly attached to the EC2 instance. It's perfect for temporary data like buffers, caches, and scratch files. However, it's not suitable for long-term storage due to its non-detachable nature.

## Amazon EBS

**Amazon EBS** is designed for data that changes frequently and needs to persist through instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures. It offers two types of volumes:

- **SSD-backed volumes**: Ideal for transactional workloads such as databases and boot volumes. Performance is based on IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
- **HDD-backed volumes**: Suitable for throughput-intensive workloads, such as big data, data warehouses, log processing, and sequential data I/O. Performance is based on MB/s.

Key features of Amazon EBS include:

- Block storage
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model (provision storage in advance)
- Replication across multiple servers within a single Availability Zone
- Most volumes can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time

## Amazon S3

**Amazon S3** is a highly scalable and cost-effective storage solution for data that doesn't change often. It's ideal for storing static web content, media, backups, archives, and data for analytics. Additionally, it can host entire static websites with custom domain names.

Key features of Amazon S3 include:

- Object storage
- Pay-as-you-use pricing model (no need to provision storage in advance)
- Replication of objects across multiple Availability Zones within a Region
- Not tied to compute resources

## Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and Amazon FSx

For file storage that can be mounted onto multiple EC2 instances, consider using **Amazon EFS** or **Amazon FSx**. Each service has its own set of features:

- **Amazon EFS**: Fully managed NFS file system.
- **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server**: Fully managed file server built on Windows Server that supports the SMB protocol.
- **Amazon FSx for Lustre**: Fully managed Lustre file system that integrates with S3.

Both EFS and FSx offer:

- File storage capabilities
- Pay-as-you-use pricing model (no need to provision storage in advance)
- Can be mounted onto multiple EC2 instances
