# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create a virtual network in the AWS cloud. Here are the key components and concepts of Amazon VPC explained in a simple way:

**1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**

Definition: A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources (like EC2 instances, databases, etc.).

Analogy: Think of it as your own private section of the AWS cloud, like having your own piece of the internet within AWS.

**2. Subnet:**

Definition: A range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can create subnets to divide your VPC's IP address range and control the routing between them.

Analogy: Similar to dividing your home network into different sections for different purposes (e.g., one for your family's devices, another for guests).

**3. Internet Gateway:**

Definition: An internet gateway allows your VPC resources to connect to the internet.

Analogy: It's like the door to the internet for your VPC. Resources inside can go out, and responses can come back in.

**4. Route Table:**

Definition: A set of rules (routes) that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

Analogy: Think of it like a map for your network. It tells traffic where to go.

**5. Security Group:**

Definition: Acts as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

Analogy: Similar to a security guard at the entrance of a building, deciding who can enter and exit.

**6. Network Access Control List (NACL):**

Definition: A stateless, numbered list of rules that control traffic at the subnet level.

Analogy: Like a bouncer at the entrance to different sections of a club, deciding who gets in based on rules.

**7. Elastic IP Address:**

Definition: A static IP address that you can associate with an instance in your VPC.

Analogy: It's like having a fixed phone number for your device in the AWS cloud.

**8. VPC Peering:**

Definition: A connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them.

Analogy: Imagine two private neighborhoods with a secure road connecting them, allowing residents to travel freely.

**9. VPN Connection:**

Definition: A secure connection between your on-premises network and your VPC.

Analogy: Similar to a private tunnel connecting your home network to your cloud network.

**10. Direct Connect:**

Definition: A dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.

Analogy: Like having a private highway connecting your office directly to the AWS data center.

In summary, Amazon VPC provides you with the ability to create your own isolated virtual network within the AWS cloud, giving you control over the environment in which you run your resources. It helps you design and customize your network architecture based on your specific requirements.


# What are the 3 private IP address ranges?

Private IPv4 addresses have the following class configurations:

Class A IP addresses. Configurations range from 10.0. 0.0 to 10.255. 255.255.

Class B IP addresses. Configurations range from 172.16. 0.0 to 172.31. 255.255.

Class C IP addresses. Configurations range from 192.168. 0.0 to 192.168. 255.255.


# CIDR

CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a notation for representing IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. It's a more flexible way of allocating and specifying IP addresses compared to the traditional class-based addressing system. CIDR notation is expressed as an IP address followed by a forward slash and a number, representing the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, 192.168.0.0/24 specifies a network with a 24-bit prefix.

Here's how the CIDR notation breaks down:

IP Address: Represents the base address of the network.

Forward Slash (/): Separates the IP address from the prefix length.

Prefix Length: Specifies the number of bits in the network part of the address.

**Examples:**

/8 (CIDR Notation):

Binary Prefix: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
Decimal Representation: 255.0.0.0
Number of Possible Addresses: 2^24 (about 16 million)

/16 (CIDR Notation):

Binary Prefix: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
Decimal Representation: 255.255.0.0
Number of Possible Addresses: 2^16 (about 65,536)

/24 (CIDR Notation):

Binary Prefix: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Decimal Representation: 255.255.255.0
Number of Possible Addresses: 2^8 (256)

# How to Give IPs in CIDR Notation:

When you specify an IP address using CIDR notation, you are defining a range of IP addresses. The notation indicates the network part and the host part of the IP address. The host part can be used to assign specific IP addresses within that range.

For example, if you have the CIDR 192.168.1.0/24, it means the network range is from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. You can assign individual IPs within this range to devices or resources in your network.

IP Range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 (excluding network and broadcast addresses)
CIDR notation is a way to express subnet masks in a more concise and flexible manner, making it easier to manage and allocate IP addresses in networks of varying sizes.
