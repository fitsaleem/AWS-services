# what is IAM in AWS ?

*IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and it is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to manage users and their access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to create and manage user accounts, groups, and permissions, allowing you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources.*

*With IAM, you can create multiple users with unique credentials and permissions, and you can also create groups to organize your users and set permissions for them collectively. IAM enables you to assign policies to users and groups to grant or deny access to specific AWS resources, as well as to monitor and audit user activity to maintain security and compliance.*

*IAM is a critical component of AWS security and is essential for organizations that need to manage access to their AWS resources securely and efficiently.*

# example of how IAM works in AWS:

*Let's say you have an AWS account and you want to give your developers access to your Amazon S3 bucket to upload and download files. Instead of creating individual AWS user accounts for each developer and granting them access to the S3 bucket individually, you can create an IAM group called "Developers" and add the developers to the group. Then, you can create an IAM policy that allows the "Developers" group to read and write objects to the S3 bucket.*

***Here are the steps to set up IAM in this scenario:***

*1: Create an IAM group called "Developers" and add the developers to the group.*

*2: Create an IAM policy that allows the "Developers" group to read and write objects to the S3 bucket.*

*3: Attach the policy to the "Developers" group.*

*4: Test the access by logging in as one of the developers and accessing the S3 bucket.*

*By using IAM in this way, you can easily manage access to your AWS resources, and make sure that your developers have the right level of access to do their job, while still maintaining security and compliance. You can also add or remove developers from the "Developers" group as needed, and the access policy will automatically apply to them.*

# why aws recomanded to do not use root user ?

*AWS recommends not using the root user for security reasons. The root user is the initial user account created when you sign up for an AWS account, and it has unlimited access to all AWS services and resources within that account. This makes it a high-value target for attackers, and if the root user's credentials are compromised, it can result in a significant security breach.*

# What is IAM limits In AWS ?

*Yes, AWS has set certain limits for IAM resources to ensure the stability and reliability of the IAM service. These limits may vary by region, and some limits can be increased by contacting AWS support. Here are some common IAM limits*

1: Users: Each AWS account can have up to 5,000 IAM users. This limit can be increased by contacting AWS support.

2: Groups: Each AWS account can have up to 300 IAM groups.

3: Roles: Each AWS account can have up to 1,000 IAM roles.

4: Policies: Each IAM entity (user, group, or role) can have up to 10 managed policies attached to it, and each managed policy can have up to 6,144 characters in its policy document.

5: Policy versions: Each managed policy can have up to 5 versions.

6: Role policies: Each IAM role can have up to 10 inline policies attached to it.

7: Instance profiles: Each AWS account can have up to 1,000 instance profiles.

8: Role sessions: Each role session can last up to 12 hours.

9: MFA devices: Each IAM user can have up to 2 active MFA devices at a time.

*It's important to be aware of these limits when planning your IAM implementation and ensure that you don't exceed them. If you do hit a limit, you can contact AWS support to request an increase or consider implementing alternative strategies to manage your resources.*


# IAM Features in AWS:

*IAM has several important features that make it a powerful tool for managing access to AWS resources. Here are some of the most important features of IAM:*

1: Multifactor authentication (MFA): IAM supports MFA, which requires users to provide a second form of authentication (such as a code from a mobile app or hardware token) in addition to their password. This provides an extra layer of security and helps prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources.

2: Federation: IAM supports federation with external identity providers (such as Active Directory) using standard protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect. This allows you to use your existing identity management infrastructure and extend it to your AWS resources.
